#### Greenhouse Agriculture Maintenance with MicroDrones

Abstract :
We propose a Swarm based micro-aerial drone robots, to
spray insecticides for precision agriculture in
greenhouses.

In this approach, A sprayer(filled syringe) is attached to
the underbody of a micro-aerial drone. The plunger is
activated to spray the liquid using an electro-mechanical
actuator, the rotor wash is used to spread over an area

The target area is set based on the type of plant. Using
CV the individual leaf/stalk is identified and
predetermined quantity is sprayed.

Usage of insecticide for agriculture has a destructive
effect of the soil. The inefficiency of existing systems
is are dependent of the factors viz., Human error, Wind
direction, Distance between plants, Height of plants.

With Swarm of micro drones, the inefficiency can be
reduced to a large extent.
