* Area of Interest
  * Crew Life support system design
* Inspiration 
  * Honeybee exploring a tilted window
  * Preserving houseplants
* Algorithm
  * Navigation - Shetty's Replication Algorithm
    * Create replica's at intersections to solve sub-problems & return to start point if no optimal
      solution is found
    * Store information in Tree/Graph node's and replicate till all sub-problems are solved
    * Memory is global access, but local write, on reaching the waypoint, Complete tree/graph is updated
    * Test Hypothesis
      * Maze Solver
      * Rubik's cube
        * Start with 4 replica's to cover all orientation movement
        * Keep max replica's to half of System thread capacity
  * Orientation - Cold Boot
  * Sensor - 
    * Vision
      * Plant identification - Side/Top View Image
        * Measure Number of Plants - Top View Image
      * Growth Measurement
        * Identify and Locate Leaves, Stem, Branch - Pheno-Typing
      * Soil moisture
  * Agriculture 
    * preparation of soil
    * sowing 
    * adding manure and fertilizers
    * irrigation
    * harvesting
    * storage
  * Food requirements
    * Dietary requirement - [API from Ammanaaduge](https://github.com/slabstech/ammanaaduge.com/issues/2)
    


* Goal/Purpose
  * Garuda - Design and Features
   * Inspiration
* Solution
* Improvements
