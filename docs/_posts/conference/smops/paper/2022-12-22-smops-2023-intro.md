Introduction

Bhoomi is a swarm robotics platform to build Habitats. Each robot in the swarm is independent
and completes functional requirements autonomously. Multiple robots collaborate to complete a
complex task. Robots consist of Rover(UGV), Quadcopter(UAV/), Humanoid(Digital twin). VR map
model is generated by the Habitat Monitor system for real time visualization and tracking progress
of robots. Each robot has a fallback position, for human operators to intervene for complex task
processes
