To survive on Mars for 99+ days, A million miles away from bountiful earth. Mars should have a self-sustaining ecosystem.

The self-sustaining should be built and running efficiently before the 1st Human lift-off from Earth.

We are building "ಭೂಮಿ : Bhoomi" an autonomous Habitat to grow food required for sustaining space explorers.

The Habitat will be part pre-fabricated during logistics delivery to Mars and will be setup, maintained and monitored
perpetually by a Swarm of robots. 

* Phases 
  1. Pre-fabricated components delivery
  2. Startup sequence for Robotic swarms
  3. Setup of Kalpavruksha - Greenhouse module
    * UGV - Soil + Seed
    * UAV - Water + Nutrients
    * UAV + UGV - Monitor and Harvest
    * RO - Pre- and post-process Harvest
