### Abstract 

* Purpose
  * Bhoomi is a swarm robotics platform to build Habitats. Each robot
  in the swarm is independent and completes functional requirements autonomously.
  Multiple robots collaborate to complete a complex task. Robots consist of
  Unmanned Ground Vehicles(UGV/Rover), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAV/Quadcopter),
  Humanoid(Digital twin). VR map model is generated by the Habitat Monitor system for real time
  visualization and tracking progress of robots. Each robot has a fallback position, for human operator to
  intervene for complex task process.
