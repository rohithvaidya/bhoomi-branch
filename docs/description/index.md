    Swarm Drone Rotor Wash - A mechanism to maintain and clean solar arrays using a swarm of drones.

For Swarm Drone Rotor Wash -

Maintenance Swarm Drones which clean the dust of Solar Array Panels in remote locations autonomously.

The rotor wash of the drone's propeller would be directed at the panels to blow away the minute dirt accumulated throughout the day.

Using Vision Position System(VPS) the grids would be assigned to individual drones based on its health parameters. Using 2/3 wide angle camera lens, 360 deg view would be constantly monitored for SLAM.

Autonomous drones would be wirelessly charged during excess peak output to conserve energy for critical systems.

The intended deployment would be initial Mars Landing, where Autonomous systems build a minimum viable habitation facility.

The algorithm can be customised to replace the fuel based hand held leaf blower locally.

We demonstrate the working of the Autonomous system and also the fail safe mechanism required for uninterrupted power generation


For Greenhouse Maintenance

In this approach, A filled syringe is attached to the underbody of a micro-aerial drone. The plunger is activated to spray the liquid using an electo-mechanical actuator.

The target area is set based on the type of plant. Using CV the individual leaf/stalk is identified and predetermined quantity is sprayed.


Usage of insecticide for agriculture has a destructive effect of the soil.

The existing method of using body-mounted hand-pump based system is inefficient in terms of



    Insecticide quantity used
    Sqaure area of land covered

The ineffieciency is are dependent of the factors below



    Human error
    Wind direction
    Distance between plants
    Height of plants
    Type of plants viz., large leaf, small leaf
    Spray Nozzle

On a conservative method/approach, the insecticide is sprayed ineffectively over an area due to human error or field of view. The error is could a due to a combination of factors viz.,



    Fatigue
    region of interest as a small dense area, cumbersome to traverse
    Reduced plant to plant coverage due to height of plants
